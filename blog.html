            <h4>Zepp Golf 3D Swing Analyzer</h4>
            <h5>January 31, 2017</h5>
            <p>So recently for Christmas, I bought my dad a Zepp Golf 3D Swing Analyzer. It was, I believe, the perfect solution to a problem my dad was having. My dad’s often complains about the distance he can hit his ball. This is caused by his downswing being extremely under the club plane. This problem slows down the club head speed and also causes other problems with direction, precision, weight and balance. To complicate the matter, my dad has low awareness of the position of his club face during the downswing. His lack of awareness makes it impossible for him to practice drills for fixing his downswing alone. He was also unwilling to spend the time and money on coaches to help him fix his swing.
                <br>
                <br> The Zepp Swing Analyzer solved both problems of helping my dad understand where his club face was after each swing and being a relatively cheap and time friendly solution. It was easy to use, easy to install and did not disrupt one’s usual routine. You just tell the Zepp app that you are about to swing and then it records your next swing. It is even able to filter out the wobbles people make before a shot and most practice swings. As someone who has played golf at a high level before, I can confidently say the Zepp gives you all the information necessary to improve your swing. You just have to understand how to use the information provided. After each swing, the Zepp stores your swing angle, swing speed, tempo as well as many other statistics. You can easily look at the numbers or look at a 3D rendition of your swing. The numbers alone would probably not mean anything to most people, but you can download the swings of a golf professional and compare your numbers to them. Zepp furthermore adds video tips on how to improve different aspects of your game. While the information given may not be as accurate as the usual thousand-dollar golf equipment, a simple $90 clip on your glove can give all the same information for a fraction of the price. For an amateur golfer like my dad, saving more than $1000 for 5 mph difference seems very worth it.
                <br>
                <br> One of the Zepp’s best feature is how clearly it illustrates one’s club plane. With two clearly contrasting colors, you can see the movement of your club head in comparison to a flat plane. A play button and a slider at the bottom of the screen allow you to see everything in real time speeds or you can drag the slider around at a speed of your choosing. Without anyone else looking at his swing, my dad could review his own swing after each shot. He can also review how much he has improved and what drills help him improve the most by looking through a history of all his swings.
                <br>
                <br> While the Zepp is a really useful tool, there are some improvements that can help streamline the user experience. Adding the ability to record multiple swings at once, being able to overlay videos and showing a chart of all past statistics are just some quick fixes that can aid users on producing a more focused practice regime and more quickly ascertain how much they have improved. All in all, the Zepp Golf 3D Swing Analyzer is still one of the most convenient and useful golf tools I have seen in a while. </p>

            <h4>Updated Personal Website Design</h4>
            <h5>December 6, 2016</h5>
            <p>Finished recreating my personal website. Went for a clean and minimal design. The old website looked a bit too gaudy for me. Mostly just used HTML and CSS with a smattering of jQuery. Hope you enjoy!</p>

            <h5>November 2, 2016</h5>
            <p>Created a vertical wordpress plugin to display partners and sponsors for an organization. The partners displayed are partitioned by what services they provide. This was my first time working with wordpress. An example can be found <a href="https://www.hotelsbyday.com/blog/partner/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Using Google Map's Javascript api and a KML layer, I created a <a href="https://www.hotelsbyday.com/en/map">map</a> feature for the Hotels By Day website. Users are able to search for hotels by location or name and can click on location markers for more information.</p>

            <h4>Soylent</h4>
            <h5>January 27, 2016</h5>
            <p>The first time I heard about Soylent was during Cal Hacks. One of my team members came back to my table with an excited look on his face and a white, opaque bottle in his arms. He proudly held out the bottle and excitedly proclaimed it was Soylent. Curious, I asked what Soylent was to which he simply responded this was the future of food. I was intrigued. At the end of Cal Hacks, my fellow hackers and I convinced my friend to crack open his bottle and we toasted our success with shots of Soylent. The smooth if mostly tasteless drink pleasantly surprised my palette.
                <br>
                <br> Upon further research, I found that encased in that opaque bottle is a full meal. Derived from soy, beets and algae extracts is a concoction that contained 400 calories as well as 20% of a person’s daily nutritional need. I decided to order my own box of Soylent and after scouring the web for some coupons, subscribed to a monthly subscription of 12 bottles.
                <br>
                <br> As someone who didn’t feel full after eating all you can eat Korean barbeque, I was skeptical about how effective Soylent would be. However I soon found out that I didn’t feel hungry after consuming Soylent. Furthermore, I didn’t have that horrible feeling I get after eating fast food. It was everything that I wanted a quick meal to be. It was a simple meal packaged into an attractive looking bottle. It was healthier than other quick food options. Fast food and instant ramen neither offered the convenience of a bottle or its breadth of nutrients while still offering the same cheap price.
                <br>
                <br> As people are becoming more health conscious, the popularity of fast, canned and processed foods is declining. With few viable options, Soylent is a novel product that offers an alternative for cheap healthy energy. Furthermore with the population of Earth increasing, the problem goes further than millennial finding some new hipster nutritious meal. The ecological impact of current food will become unsustainable to support future populations. Over 700 million people in the world already go hungry each year and without some drastic change to how we grow and distribute food, only more people will be hungry in the future. Many alternative foods have been tested from lab grown meats to genetically modified vegetables. While not one of these solutions alone will solve the future problem of feeding an ever growing population, Soylent combined with other novel might just solve our future hunger problems.
                <br>
                <br> I do think that long-term drinking of Soylent can be a bit joyless. It lacks the social aspect that is usually associated with food. As a result, I am not proposing everyone should switch to drinking just Soylent. Go out and eat with your friends from time to time. Buy your own ingredients and cook your own meals when you’re trying to be healthy. However if you are in need of a simple meal replacement, Soylent is a great product.
